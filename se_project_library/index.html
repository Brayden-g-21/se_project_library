            easy to buy into the misconception that this field was mostly
            dominated by men, but our lecture aims to change that notion and
            prove that this hasn't been the case since at least the 18th
            century.

          <p class="about__paragraph">
            Libraries are essential establishments in practically every city,
            and Practicum's library is no exception. It first opened its doors
            way back in 2018, right as our humble town began bidding welcome to
            its very first citizens!
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            Since its initial opening, the library has seen nearly 342 visitors
            each month. That's almost 50% of our population! So far, most
            citizens have enjoyed reading books and making use of our ample
            online resources.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            The library gets its name from Joan Feynman, an American
            astrophysicist and the first woman to be elected as an officer of
            the American Geophysical Union.
